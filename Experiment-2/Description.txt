This is my Experiment Responsive Banking UI with Deposit/Withdrawal Buttons and Balance Display
I used the btn class for the Deposit and Withdraw buttons.
Added a box  to show the balance that is:
A Deposit button whish is in green colour.
A Withdraw button which is in red colour.

Then used CSS class named .btn to style both buttons:
Made them full width
Added padding and margin
Changed cursor to pointer on hover
css kept background in white, Justified content on center and kept the cursor as pointer.
The design is responsive, so it looks good on desktop and mobile screens.
